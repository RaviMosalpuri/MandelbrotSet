Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a two-dimensional set with a relatively simple definition that exhibits great complexity, especially as it is magnified. It is popular for its aesthetic appeal and fractal structures. The set is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at z=0, i.e., for which the sequence f_c(0),f_c(f_c(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
